Day 3
Problems/concerns coming into class:
- Hopefully assignments were done correctly.
    -Update via canvas: grade updated, so I must've done it correctly.  Nice!
- Was I too early submitting reading assignments?
    -Update via slack: no, reading assignment dates are advised but no hard deadline.

Notes in class
calendar updated
	- lecture 2 has been updated due to class 1 being extended
	- the 15th is optional co-op due to holiday; if you are able to come in, please do
	- journal due "today"
	- prepare for long hours from 17th to end
	- 18th is exam
	- 3rd = final presentations pushed back so time in morning to prep

Only assignments with "Code" have strict deadlines
	- submit to avoid late penalties, can resubmit later

Labs
	- see TAs as "first line", then seek Rachel
	- finish the requirements first, then look into adding code; avoid missing information
	- re-read assignments multiple times to ensure all assignments are being done correctly

good software devs are good googlers - they know how to find answers for their problems

downloading fork
1. fork button on repository
2. clone/copy clipboard
3. in terminal, navigate to directory (201)
4. git clone "paste website"
5. cd into the repository
6. git remote -v
should see 2 lines of information.  you can fetch or push requests.

to update
1. git remote add upstream "website"
2. to confirm it is working, re-enter git remote -v

syncing a fork
1. in terminal, git pull upstream master

git add .
git commit -m 'added comments'
git push origin master = goes into repository in github

code review - we each read one line outloud.  helps us learn and communicate better
"line #, opening X tag, "content", ending X tag."
concatonates (not sue how its spelled)

Karinne
- best time to contact her is later in the evenings
- halfway mark, will reach out to confirm you will continue to next class (301)
    - if spots are running low, will reach out to us sooner
- 6 weeks to submit/resubmit all assignments
- exam grade requirement is currently 70%, updated to 80%
- read/check your emails
- 201 and 301s day courses repeat every month
- final exam is the 301 entrance exam

Documentation
- readme and journals
- Each project will take ~2 weeks: about me assignment due on the 20th!!
- MVPs = basic requirements.  ensure these are done first
- stretch goals = additonal extensions
- .html, .js, .css are file extensions
- TA's linters will have more corrections than what we currently have

html
link to css = link src to css file

javascript
- 'use strict'; = use exactly

What did I accomplished/learned?
- I learned a lot!
    - forking
    - git repositories and how to upload to git.
    - how to link css and js files to html
    - continued learning javascript.  Definitly need more practice
- Karinne and Rachel gave up a lot of useful information for upcoming troubles and areas to be concenred about
- Created a git repository for LS journals
- how to use git commands to update github
- completed journal entry for yesterday and today.

Questions or concerns
- wondering if i will be able to retain all of this knowledge in my head.  I know i have these notes, but i'm always paranoid that as soon as i sleep, it will all go away.
- Wondering how I will be able to complete all of the necessities for the next assignment.  hopefully i can accomplish a lot in tomorrow's lab.
- Will we have to update CSS and html as we go?  since we would branch off elements with classes and ids, would we do that before or during CSS coding?  same with JS?
