I learned a lot!

Functions and how they work.  Good demos but definitely need more work on them.
CSS!  Got some lessons on images, text formatting, alignments, boxes and how to manipulate settings.
How to view code in the browser and a lot of reference links to help us out!

Some things in our lectures:
- id (# in CSS) = only one element can be an id
- class (. in CSS) = many elements can be in same class
- header, main, and footer are not h1, so default will be small boxes with just text
- CSS comments are /* ... */
- * at top will affect the entire page
- id with *, all content will get the styling individually
- split editor can help see 2 pages at the same time
- change order of divs to change order of affects


images
- to be safe, use free images, your own, or give credit
	- to give credit, can use alt tag or readme
- pexels.com is free images
- market for CSS for those interested
- so much control in CSS will hopefully remove the need for <br>, <hr>, etc.
	-padding or margin
- if only changing width, height should change automatically

Some reminders for myself:
- lots of career development assignments added; lot of us looking forward for improving career paths
- no longer using styling in html, all in css.  Bold and italics included
- pixels widely used over percentage
- html form will be taught next week
- Saturday will be lab 4 and 5; no speaker.  TA's will be present
- poor communication, poor participation, and bad behavior will be graded and determine if student is eligible for advancing to 301
	- have to be together; cannot fork on it and work separately
	- don't over complicate it

Looking forward to doing some pair projects and see how well I can do and assist others!
