We had a lot to absorb:

Object Literals
- a place to store function or data to be called upon at a later time
- all content goes within curly braces
- all proto information is created by javascript
- can include objects within objects!  Be careful how much information you have in an object
- can include arrays as well
- stick with notations to make it easier and simpler for yourself
- .push() will add to an array.  Can access arrays like you would normally.
- X.Y will call out object properties; continue dot notation to get more information
	- no shortcuts
- bracket notations.  Be sure to include quotes
- add property by doing something like: object.new value = new value  IE - "wolf.tagged = true"
- delete by delete object.property IE - "delete wolf.tagged"
- {} can create an object; anything can be an object


This
-  keyword, this version of this object: this is my computer


DOM tree
- nodes related to each other: parent, child, granchild, etc.
- global attributes and class attributes and how they interact with each other
- pinpoint specific attributes in html
- browser goes through a lot of process before a webpage is displayed
	- we need to understand how it works and what is going on with the browser
- DOM transversal = move around the DOM tree.  document in console
- DOM manipulation
- native code = native to the built
- getElementById creates into an object
- getters = pulling information already in the DOM  IE - h1El.id
- setters = changes the content to different value in the element IE - h1El.textContent = "something clever"
	- will not stay if you refresh; will go back to the hardcoded DOM tree

It was good to go over the content we had to read.  The reading was a bit confusing, but now it makes more sense.  Hopefully more will be clarified in the lab tomorrow.
