Local Storage:
- on console, application > local storage
- localStorage.clear(); = one way to clear
	- lots of clearing
- on "lighter side", implementing something to your code
	- should be ~10-15 more lines of code
- json (not jason) = javascript object notation - way to convert our code into less binary
	- java is different than javascript
- why?
   - faster load
   - less memory
- linter is a json
- 2 ways to use JSON
	- JSON.stringify(obj) = encodes the code
	- JSON.parse(variable); = takes out of string form and returns to javascript form (decode)
- obj === JSON.parse(jsonObj); returns false.  why?
	- when we stringify it, it becomes a copy, but it is not the original information
	- once stringified, it is completely different
- cookies vs local storage?
	- we don't use cookies and don't have time to go too much in details; please google
- think as converting to JSON and storing it to locale storage
- Locale storage is an object with stringified data (red text)
	- property = store data
- MDN not as helpful for locale storage; best practice is to mess with it
- Stores in key valued pairs

Encoding or setting in database
- JSON.stringify();
- localStorage.setItem();
Retrieving and reverting to javascript
- localStorage.getItem();
- JSON.parse();
(in slack now.  Thanks Rachel!)

- JSON validator
	- copy storage info and paste to validate
	- objects displayed correctly; errors if wrong
	- most demanding on data
