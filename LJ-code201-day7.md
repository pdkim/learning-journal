Today we went over:
Obect literal demo
- javascript will do the work so it can respond to company changes
- key value is a property of an object

Math functions:
Math.random()

Math.floor = round down to nearest whole number but not the number
	IE: Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) will give us 0-3 but not 4
	-to get 4, you need to add 1 at the end

Math.ceil = round up

Lab7 Problem domain
- Replace list with a table; very difficult

Constructor Functions = template
- think like a factory with methods

There was so much to go over and so quickly that this class was the hardest to keep up with. Some name changes in the class demo threw me off a bit, but I will look over the code as an opportunity to debug. I would like to spend some more time on constructors, but given the point we are at now, that may hinder us on the topics we still need to learn.  hopefully lab 6 and 7 will clarify the object literals and constructors.
