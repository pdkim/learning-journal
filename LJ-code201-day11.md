Debugging (Lina)
- debugger;
	- can be thrown anywhere; does not have to be underneath 'use strict'
	- should open tab in console  under sources
- needed to go to sales page in order to find debuggers
- click step button to go through code
- debugger going really fast through the code; not sure why....
- step into function call and then step into further; back and forth
- ctrl+o to search for file (not sure what windows equivalent is)
- breakpoint; cick on line you want, refresh, and move down in console
	- quicker than debugger; just need to refresh often
	- have lots of console.log
