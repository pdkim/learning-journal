Things we learned today:
- fixed mind-set vs growth mind-set
- whole time here, will be on growth mind-set; will fail all the time but you're learning
- staying in fixed mind-set is stagnant; comforting but not engaging/learning.  False sense of security
- Will occur during white-boarding process in interview: growth mind-set

Feedback:
- only allowed umber of labs: unable to add more
- school is based on referral; without good survey, less students
- willing to adapt, but needs more feedback
- feeling rushed; trying to fill in a lot.  either less information or try to absorb as much as you can
	- be more specific on "rushed"
- be open for resubmissions; will not get it right the first time(s)
- next lab is up
- reading directions and ask for help is crucial; ok to ask if you don't know what to ask
- consider tutor program

Lab 8
- create "simple" html form
	- needs to add a new store in the table; all values must update correctly
- our form and new data will not stay in after refresh
- event listener, event handler
- facilitate DOM access
- error page

Form demo
- form tags, both opening and closing
- create data from the user
- fieldset = group related elements in the form.  information stored within a form
- within form, to style in html is allowed
- legend is a title for your form
	- not required for lab, but can be included with it
- label = setting up for some data
- input = waiting on input from user
- textarea is field user can write text
- get method will get information from a server.  will learn more in 301.

Events Demo
- HTML is structure, CSS is style, Javascript is interactivity(Events)
- Click me > browser fires event > JS hears the event > JS handles the event
- element.addEventListener('type', handlerFunction);
- innerHTML is open to hacks, but for this assignment, it is ok
- event.preventDefault(); must have it to prevent page reload.
- if statement for no value in our form
