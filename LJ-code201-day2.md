Troubles:
-UBuntu still not working.  Luckily Chris was able to contact me via slack and walk me through virtual box.  Ubuntu seems to be working there.

Notes in class:
- Windows users will be asigned to windows TA (chris).  He will be responsible for grading our assignments.
- All classes will be on youtube for future review (unknown...)
- slack and canvas best form of communication
- Github is network to save/store code; assignments will go to here
	- class collaboration
	- saves code so it is not lost when murphy strikes

Terminal commands
cd= change directory
pwd = locate where you are in terminal
ls = list content
cd + enter or ~ will bring you back to the root
mkdir = make directory
code = opens code editor
code ."name" = opens specific code
touch "name" = creates file
start "name" = open file in internet browser
	*open in mac
rm "name" = remove files
	*rm cannot delete directory, use below!
rm -rf "name" = remove directory


Internet/Chrome
right-click + inspect = inspect code

Git commands

git add = add curent file
git commit -m '' = commit with message

directory for computer = "root"/codefellows/201
	*DO NOT MAKE another codefellows or 201, make new directory

1. git config --global core.editor code
2. code .eslintrc.json
3. code .bashrc

assignment = codefellows/201

What i accomplished?
- learned some JS
	- if and else statements refresher
	- console and log
	- alerts
- Some refresher with HTML
- Was able to to finish my code assignment (for now).
- read chapters for reading assignment and submitted quiz.
- successfully got linux on a virtual machine.  Special thanks to Chris!

Questions/concerns
- Are we learning to enter JS code into our HTML files?  our reading seems to indicate having separate files for all 3.
- When are reading assignments due?  The due date says right before class.
- Hopefully virtual box/machine will be sufficient.
