Day 10

Things we learned today:

- How did salmon cookies go?  It was hard!  We learned a lot though
	What was hardest part?  Javascript (some said CSS but that's a lie).
- New project this week
	- lab 6, 7, 8 were the top curve of the course
	- still challenging
	- we are ahead; wireframe is a bit farther in advanced
- some more wireframing assignments/code review
- can resubmit assignments
	- will we be able to resubmit for lab 12-14 since they are so late?
		-Rachel will extend for resubmission but unlikely we will have much time
- blog post about 201 projects
	- Rachel will assign groups; high expectations
- talks with rachel will be 30 minutes: be prepared
- stress on meetup; work with others to go as a group
	- please slack so people can go
- Quiz 4 on Wednesday
- wireframe on thursday
	- do in either codepen or canvas; prep for chocolate pizza/projects
	- should be less than 4hrs
	- instructions in class 9
- Chocolate pizza: format html first then CSS to prep
	- paired program
- Bus mall
	- lab 12
	- chart js
- friday co-ops on 23rd and march 2nd
	- 25th = day off/ will take co-op lab off
	- expect bugs on the end of february, be prepared


Feedback
- Thank you for understanding with confusion with canvas; new curriculum being introduced to night course
- more emphasis on due dates
- time managements of TAs; be considerate of others who need help: about 15min per help
- more time for one on one meetings with Rachel
	- keep in touch with Rachel; will help out when she has times
- comments in lecture video


Final projects:
- be unique
- Are all of these 201 projects?
	-yes!  No way?!  They are
- games are hard
- pitch your idea; rachel determines groups based on shared idea's or no desire to lead
- final presentation @ 3PM.  bring people if you want
- be sure to be 90% before projects week: unlikely projects will bump up too much


Code Review (Lina)
- add console log for a lot of debugging
- "this instance" or "this version" for reading code out loud
- assign to 0 so we can have a variable for manipulation
- delete row: you have to go bottom up otherwise it the values will affect the for loop and will stop at 3 or something


Code demo (wireframe)
- semantic = readability, we know what they are and what they will do: links go into nav(navigation)
	- good CSS makes it easy for people to read and understand for others
- must use alt tags for images: for screen readers or disabilities
	- failure to include them will fail tests
- CSS margin auto = horizontally centers the element within the container
	- margin is your best friend
- think responsive
- do not use flex box/flex block?; do not use in 201
	- need to understand what it does and the foundations of CSS
- old way was using float
	- use display: inline-block....wish i knew this sooner.....
- margin using top right bottom left can be margin; top, right, bottom, left instead of margin-top, margin-right, etc.
- margin will be dependant of parent
- is it important the div inside a section?
	- for semantic purposes yes, because div can be anything versus section, main, etc
	- can isolate elements further within the div, but controlled within parenting
- mess around in console.  useful for debugging and editing code

A lot of things clarified with CSS.  Wish I had known some of these for salmon cookies but it is good to know now.
