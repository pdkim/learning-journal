Gathered a lot of information on arrays and loops during Rachel's lecture and lab.
Lab was very difficult getting loops and arrays to work per requirements.  Luckily Rachel and the TA's have been able to help out with troubleshooting issues.
Had a guest speaker, Keneth, who told us about his journey in and after codefellows.  Very interesting to hear his story and during code fellows and his journey afterwards.
Read up on the chapters regarding links, page layouts and functions.  Definitely useful to read up on all the information, specifically about page layout in CSS.
Hopefully we will go more in detail with functions during lectures.
