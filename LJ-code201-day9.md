Things learned today:

First things first:
- usually admissions survey not intended for 3rd week; meant for 6th week, in tandem with day course
- meetup requirements: make an effort to go to a place to network, but understanding that we don't have as much availability

Code Review (Eric):
- expected with events to be ~150 lines of code
- variable.setAttribute('class' , 'name') setting attribute to a class.
- in scope of larger projects, consider compiling functions together into one
- parseInt = recieves an integer; if no number, it is treating as wrong
- parseFloat = to keep decimals, this will prevent rounding numbers
- !name = they are not or empty field
- variable.removeChild = removes child to reset value to call again at a different time
- locations[locations.length-1].render? renders the last value at the end of the array

Lab 9:
- must use all images in assets per client requirements
- index html must have all information on a website; mock up but should be professional
- apply similar style to sales page.
- wireframe exercise
- prevent bugs by getting layout first, then hard stuff

Event demo 2:
- must match id in form

CSS Demo
- block elements start on outside
- inline flow between surrounding text
- one block element sits inside(nested) inside another block element, outer is containing/parent
- containing element is the immediate parent of the next element
- Add reset.css file moving forward; allows full control
    - add link to html
    - to tell if you have reset, there should be no edge
- why did image not go all the way to the left?
	- because auto is set to 0, then we adjusted top and right
	- TRBL
- none will remove old rules/styling: list-style: none   will remove bullets in list!

hopefully coding will go well in tomorrow's lab so I can invest good time on CSS.
